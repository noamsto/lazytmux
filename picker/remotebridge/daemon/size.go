// tmux applies it as a clamp *after* window-size's own calculation (resize.c
// clients_calculate_size), whereas the whole-client form loses that
// calculation outright — under window-size latest every client but w->latest
// is skipped.

// currently has it selected (resize.c, clients_calculate_size_skip_client's
// `current` branch). The bridge holds one control client on the mirrored
// session, so it is "on" one window at a time: for every other mirrored window
// no client contributes a size, ConvergeCmd's cap is accepted and then
// discarded during recalculation, and the window keeps whatever size it last
// held — or default-size if it never held one (#478).

// attached to the remote still clamps the window down.

// only 230ms later, once ConvergeCmd's per-window cap lands). Anything the
// remote starts in that gap reads the wrong terminal size.
