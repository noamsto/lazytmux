# Tag a window as a worktree window — @worktree/@branch/@git_root, then @issue_*
# via the existing stamp. Idempotent, navigation-free, CLAUDECODE-agnostic. The
# single place that defines HOW a window gets tagged: fired at window creation
# (after-new-window/after-new-session) so any window — whoever created it (a raw
# `tmux new-window`, a dispatcher, a tmux-remux restore) — becomes a first-class
# worktree window, and reused by the worktrunk post-switch hook for navigation.
#
# Usage:
#   tmux-reconcile-window <target>               # cwd-derived (creation hooks)
#   tmux-reconcile-window <target> --cwd-move     # cwd-derived (#596 move detector)
#   tmux-reconcile-window <target> <worktree> <branch>  # explicit (post-switch nav)
# <target> is any tmux target; the creation hooks pass #{window_id} (globally
# unique), which sidesteps both numeric-session ambiguity and $-reexpansion.
# Explicit mode trusts its caller to name a worktree a pane is in, or moving to.
# --cwd-move marks a call from tmux-update-icons's cwd-move detector rather than
# a creation hook — see the forced-reflow gate below for why that distinction
# can't be recovered from @worktree state alone.
