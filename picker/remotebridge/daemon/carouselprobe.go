// The carousel verb's outcome has to travel from the remote back to this

// this daemon's control client, which renders no status line, so a
// display-message issued there evaporates (the same reason agentstatus.go
// pushes state at write time instead of polling for it). carouselResolveScript
// stamps its verdict on the ctl pane as carouselVerdictOpt, and this seam is
// what reads it back and turns it into the one-line notifyLocal message the
// purely-local prefix+I bind shows (#593).
