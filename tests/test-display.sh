# Mock-mode window-list regression test.
# Spawns a throwaway tmux server using the built wrapper, sets @issue_*/@pr_*
# options for the documented display states, and diffs window names against a
# golden file. Run from repo root after `nix build .#default`.
#
# Why no -n on new-session/new-window: an explicit window name disables
# automatic-rename, so the window would keep its literal name instead of
# rendering automatic-rename-format. We let auto-rename (on by default in the
# baked config) drive the name so the test captures the RENDERED enrichment.
#
# Window indices: the config sets `base-index 1`, so the initial window is
# s:1 and each new-window fills the lowest free index (s:2..s:5).

# Trailing whitespace is stripped per line: an unset @window_icon_display (no
# process icon on a mock pane) renders as a trailing space, which the
# trim-trailing-whitespace pre-commit hook would strip from the golden anyway.
# Normalizing here keeps the golden trim-clean and the comparison stable. This
# only strips the structurally-empty icon slot; a real icon is non-whitespace
# content and would still be captured and compared.

# Wait for auto-rename to settle. Renames fire window-by-window over ~300ms
# (status-interval is 1s), and a partially-renamed read can look stable for two
# consecutive polls. Require three consecutive identical reads to skip past that
